[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/leonard112/octane.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/leonard112/octane)

Octane is a scripting language built from Python. Octane is currenly in it's early alpha stages, but the intent is for Octane to build on some of the key principles that languages like Python and Ruby follow. The Goal is for Octane to have a simple and easy to read and understand syntax.

## Releases
* __0.0.1-alpha__
  * `print` function is stable. `print` can print simple strings enclosed in single or double quotes and coloring and styling be applied to text easily by by calling a specialized version of `print`. For example you can print __RED__ and __UNDERLINED__ text with the following print function: `printRedUnderline "This text is red and underlined."`
